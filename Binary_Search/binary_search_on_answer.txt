for normal binary search condition : 
            -> array must be sorted
                so,
                    we can easily compare elements of array with mid and left and right 
                    and ignore any of the side 

    what if array is unsorted and we want to apply binary search ??
        -> for that we have to decide some criteria so that we can decide where to move
            like if arr[mid]==key or arr[mid]<key or arr[mid]>key 
                for that we have to devlop some criteria to decide.

                        for that we will solve problem called "Peak element"

                        How we will got idea that we have to apply BS on any unsorted array??
                         -> their must be given any condition 
                                like Peak element : element which is greater from both of its neighbour

                BS on ans => pro
