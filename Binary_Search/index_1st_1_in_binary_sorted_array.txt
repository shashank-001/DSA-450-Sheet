Basically problem is combination of two problems:
    search an element in infinite sorted array and find first occurrence of given element

    what we can do :
        we have to apply search an element in infinite sorted array
        while(key>arr[mid]){
            res=mid;
            end=end*2;
        }

        when end will reach its position apply binary search
        change this condition : 
        if(arr[mid]==key){
            res=mid;
            end=mid-1;
        }

        other condition will be same
