    n=7
    arr[7]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,......infinite}
    size=infinite
    key=7

    Difference bteween Normal binary search and search in infinite sorted array
    -> size of infinite sorted array is not defined so we can not apply normal binary search.

    -Fix this size issue : 
        we will take start at 0 and end at 1 
        then
            we will increase increase end=end*2
                  while(key>arr[end]){
                      start=end;
                      end=end*2;
                  }

                  after that end will reach it's position and start as well

                  apply binary search on that part of infinite sorted array
                  BS(arr,start,end);
