Why Quicksort is preferred for. Arrays and Merge Sort for LinkedLists ?

-> In case of Arrays : 
    QuickSort - no extra space
    MergeSort - O(N) extra space

    Both have same time complexity = O(NlogN)
  == QuickSort will win the race here
-> In case of LL : 
    QuickSort : 
    with linked lists merge sort doesn't have the memory disadvantage, and outperforms 
    quick sort (linked lists are easy to divide, no additional memory needed to manipulate 
    it).
