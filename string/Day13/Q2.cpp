//Dynamic programming problem:

// Input: nums = {3,2,2}, k = 4
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Given a line can have 4 
// characters,
// Line number 1: From word no. 1 to 1
// Line number 2: From word no. 2 to 2
// Line number 3: From word no. 3 to 3
// Same explaination as above total cost
// = (4 - 3) + (4 - 2) = 3.
