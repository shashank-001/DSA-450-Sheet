Why strings are immutable in java ??

> Immutable : it guarrenteed that strings own value won't change

Stings are immutable because of following reason : 
  1> Security : all the parameters used in db url or routing and in username/password 
                will be changed if strings were mutable these parameters can be changed
                which will result into biggest loss.

  2> Class Loading : strings were used as arguments for class loading. if it being mutable
                     then it will result into wrong class loading.
                     (because mutable object can change their state).

  3>synchronization :

  4> Caching :
